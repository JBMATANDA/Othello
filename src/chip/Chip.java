//T'was brillig, and the slighty toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe. All mimsy were the borogoves and the mome raths outgrabe. Beware the Jabberwock my son, the jaws that bite, the claws that catch. Beware the Jujub bird and shun the frumious Bandersnatch. He took his vorpal sword in hand. Longtime the manxome foe he sought, so rested he by the tumtum tree and stood awhile in thought. And as in uffish thought he stood, the Jabberwock with eyes of flame, came whiffing through the tulgey woods and burbled as it came. One-two, one-two and through and through the vorpal blade went snicker-snack. He left it dead and with its head he went galumphing back. "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms my beamish boy! Oh frabjous day, callooh callay!" He chortled in his joy. T'was brillig, and the sligthy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe. All mimsy were the borogoves and the mome raths outgrabe.
